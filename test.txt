## Step 3: Derived Behavioral and Ratio-Based Features

The table below lists the derived features generated in Step 3.  
All features are computed **for each defined time window** (e.g. 1–3m, 1–6m, 4–6m, 7–12m, 1–12m) and are aggregated at the **application level**.

| Feature Name Pattern | Description |
|---------------------|-------------|
| `months_zero_or_neg_amount_sum_<window>` | Number of months within the window where net cashflow is zero or negative |
| `ratio_zero_or_neg_amount_sum_<window>` | Proportion of months within the window where net cashflow is zero or negative |
| `months_zero_credits_<window>` | Number of months within the window with zero credit inflows |
| `ratio_zero_credits_<window>` | Proportion of months within the window with zero credit inflows |
| `months_zero_or_neg_balance_<window>` | Number of months within the window where the minimum balance is zero or negative |
| `ratio_zero_or_neg_balance_<window>` | Proportion of months within the window where the minimum balance is zero or negative |
| `balance_trend_corr_<window>` | Correlation between time (month index) and average monthly balance within the window |
| `m_min_balance_to_mean_m_balance_<window>` | Minimum balance within the window divided by average balance within the window |
| `loan_repayment_to_turnover_<window>` | Total loan repayment within the window divided by total turnover within the window |
| `net_tax_paid_to_turnover_<window>` | Net tax paid (tax paid minus tax refunds) within the window divided by total turnover within the window |
| `tax_paid_to_turnover_<window>` | Total tax paid within the window divided by total turnover within the window |
| `min_balance_to_turnover_<window>` | Minimum balance within the window divided by total turnover within the window |
| `mean_m_min_balance_to_mean_m_turnover_<window>` | Average of monthly minimum balances within the window divided by average monthly turnover within the window |
| `mean_m_utilities_to_mean_m_turnover_<window>` | Average utilities expense within the window divided by average turnover within the window |

### Notes
- `<window>` represents the time window (e.g. `1_3m`, `1_6m`, `4_6m`, `7_12m`, `1_12m`)
- All ratio-based features use **safe normalization** (division by zero results in null values)
- These features are designed to be **interpretable and explainable**, directly reflecting observed financial behavior
