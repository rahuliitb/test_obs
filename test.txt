## 6. Segment-Level Performance Analysis

In addition to overall model performance, discriminatory power was evaluated across key portfolio segments to assess consistency and robustness within different sub-populations.

Segment-level analysis ensures that the model does not disproportionately underperform within specific customer groups and that predictive performance remains stable across relevant business dimensions.

### 6.1 Segmentation Dimensions

The following segmentation variables were used:

- **LEGAL FORM**
- **LOO Before**
- **LOO After**
- **Total Transaction Count**
- **IS_JCO** (Joint / Co-obligor indicator)
- **Product Type**
- **Segment**

For each segmentation variable, AUC was computed independently within each subgroup.

### 6.2 Evaluation Approach

Within each segment:

- The model’s AUC was calculated using the same evaluation methodology as the overall portfolio.
- Performance differences across subgroups were compared.
- Particular attention was given to identifying any material deterioration in discriminatory power within specific segments.

### 6.3 Interpretation

The segment-level analysis indicates that the model maintains comparable discriminatory power across the evaluated subgroups. While minor variations in AUC are observed between segments, no segment exhibits a disproportionate decline in performance relative to the overall portfolio.

This consistency across key business dimensions supports the robustness of the model and reduces the risk of segment-specific instability.

Overall, the segment analysis confirms that the model’s predictive performance is not concentrated in a single sub-population and remains broadly stable across the portfolio.
