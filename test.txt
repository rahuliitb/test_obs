## Monthly-Level Feature Construction

Transaction data is first aggregated at a **monthly level**.  
For each of the **12 months prior to the application month**, a wide set of monthly features is generated. In total, **around 72 monthly-level columns** are created at this stage.

The lists below show **representative examples** of the types of features computed, rather than an exhaustive list.

### Amount-Based Features (Examples)
- Monthly total credit  
- Monthly total debit  
- Monthly total turnover  

### Balance-Based Features (Examples)
- Average monthly balance  
- Minimum monthly balance  
- Maximum monthly balance  
- Standard deviation of monthly balance  
- Monthly minimum-to-maximum balance ratio  

### Category-Level Features (Examples)
Monthly transaction amounts are also aggregated for key spending and repayment categories, including but not limited to:
- Loan repayment  
- Utilities payments  
- Tax payments and tax refunds  

This step results in **12 monthly observations for each feature**, which together form the foundational time series used in all subsequent aggregation and feature derivation steps.
