## 7. Challenger Model Overview

In addition to the champion model, a challenger model was developed to provide a benchmark comparison and support model risk management requirements.

### 7.1 Model Development Framework

Both champion and challenger models share the same upstream development pipeline:

- Data preprocessing
- Feature engineering
- Feature selection

Following the final feature selection stage, **19 features** were retained. These same 19 features were used as inputs for both the champion and challenger models to ensure comparability.

### 7.2 Challenger Model Specification

The challenger model is based on **Logistic Regression**.

Prior to model estimation:

- Feature predictive power was reassessed using **Information Value (IV)**.
- Optimal binning was performed using the `optbinning` package.
- A minimum IV threshold of **0.05** was applied.
- Selected features were discretized and transformed into **Weight of Evidence (WoE)** representations.
- The WoE-transformed variables were then used as inputs to the logistic regression model.

This approach follows a traditional scorecard-style modeling framework and provides a transparent, linear benchmark against the champion model.

### 7.3 Performance Comparison

The comparative discriminatory performance is summarized below:

| Model | OOS AUC (%) | OOT AUC (%) |
|--------|--------------|--------------|
| Champion (LightGBM) | 75.11 | 74.50 |
| Challenger (Logistic Regression) | 71.30 | — |

The challenger model demonstrates lower out-of-sample discriminatory power relative to the champion model. The performance difference reflects the greater modeling flexibility of the gradient boosting approach used in the champion model.

### 7.4 Summary

The challenger model serves as a benchmark alternative using a more traditional modeling framework. While it provides interpretability through WoE-transformed features and a linear structure, its predictive performance is lower compared to the champion model.

The comparison supports the selection of the champion model for production deployment based on superior discriminatory performance.
