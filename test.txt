I will provide:
1) Feature generation code
2) A list of example features produced by that code

Your task is to write OVERALL FEATURE DOCUMENTATION, not a code explanation.

Please generate the documentation in **Markdown format**.

The document should:
- Explain the purpose and intent of the feature set
- Group features conceptually (using the example feature names only for guidance)
- Describe feature logic at a high level (no implementation details)
- Explain business / behavioral intuition behind each feature group
- Describe time windows and aggregations conceptually
- Explain how missing values, outliers, and edge cases are handled (at a design level)
- **Discuss potential data leakage risks and how they are mitigated**
- **Describe feature stability considerations and monitoring expectations**
- **Explain how the features support model interpretability and explainability**
- State assumptions, limitations, and model risk considerations
- Describe how these features should be used and monitored in downstream models

STRICT RULES:
- Do NOT explain the code line by line
- Do NOT describe functions, variables, or syntax
- Do NOT restate or rewrite the code
- Use example feature names only to infer feature groups, not to explain code logic

Audience:
- Data scientists
- Model validation / model risk teams
- Risk and business stakeholders

Formatting requirements:
- Use clear Markdown headings (##, ###)
- Use bullet points where appropriate
- Include a concise summary table where helpful
- Keep the language professional, precise, and regulator-friendly

IMPORTANT:
If you start explaining how the code works technically, STOP and rewrite at a higher, conceptual level.
