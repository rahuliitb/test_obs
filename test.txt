The difference between In-Time (82.23%) and cross-validated OOS AUC (75.11%) represents an absolute decrease of 7.12 percentage points (approximately 8.7% relative decline).

For flexible ensemble methods such as gradient boosting (including LightGBM), it is common to observe a noticeable gap between development and cross-validated performance due to the model’s ability to capture complex patterns within the training data. This difference is generally interpreted as expected in-sample optimism rather than structural overfitting, provided that cross-validated (OOS) and Out-of-Time (OOT) performance remain comparable.

The Out-of-Time AUC (74.50%) is closely aligned with the cross-validated OOS estimate (75.11%), with a difference of 0.61 percentage points.

Overall, the consistency between OOS and OOT performance indicates that the model generalizes appropriately and maintains stable discriminatory power when applied to future data. The observed IT–OOS gap does not suggest material overfitting.
