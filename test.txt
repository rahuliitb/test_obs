## 4. Percentage Change (Trend) Features

To capture **trends and directional changes** in customer behavior, percentage change features are derived from the aggregated features created in previous steps.

### Window Comparisons

Percentage change is computed between predefined window pairs, for example:
- **1–3 months vs. 4–6 months**
- **1–6 months vs. 7–12 months**

This logic is applied **uniformly to all eligible features** generated in Steps 2 and 3.

### Computation Formula

For each feature and window pair `(win1, win2)`, percentage change is computed as:

Percentage Change = ( X_recent − X_historical ) / X_historical

Where:
- `X_recent` is the feature value from the more recent time window  
- `X_historical` is the feature value from the earlier historical window  

If the denominator is zero, the percentage change value is set to null.
